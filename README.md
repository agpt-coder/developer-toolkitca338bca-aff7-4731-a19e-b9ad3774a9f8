# Developer Toolkit

Based on our discussions regarding the Multi-Purpose API Toolkit, we've identified key features and requirements that will guide the development process. The toolkit, designed to serve a myriad of functionalities within a single endpoint, eliminates the need for integrating multiple third-party services. Here are the detailed insights gathered from our interview sessions: 

1. **Scalability and Performance**: There are no specific scalability concerns or performance benchmarks that the API needs to meet for the project at this stage. However, efficient data processing and high availability remain paramount to ensure a seamless user experience.

2. **Data Privacy and Security Features**: No specific preferences or requirements for data privacy and security features were mentioned. Still, secure authentication methods were emphasized to protect sensitive information, indicating an underlying need for robust security measures.

3. **Key Functionalities**: The project prioritizes real-time data processing, robust error handling, and secure authentication methods. These features aim to maintain data security and operational reliability while delivering a seamless user experience.

4. **Primary User Scenario**: Tailoring for SMEs managing their sales pipelines and customer relations, the toolkit must facilitate easy data entry, efficient retrieval of information, and insightful analytics to enhance the decision-making process.

5. **System Integration Requirements**: Integration with CRM systems, payment gateways, and third-party cloud services was highlighted as crucial. This ensures seamless data exchange and functionality enhancement, emphasizing the need for versatile API capabilities such as currency exchange rates, IP geolocation data, and real-time insights via data analytics tools integration.

The development will leverage the specified tech stack (Python with FastAPI, PostgreSQL database, and Prisma ORM) to address these requirements. The API toolkit will include endpoints for QR code generation, currency exchange rates, IP geolocation, image resizing, password strength checking, text-to-speech conversion, barcode generation, email validation, time zone conversion, URL preview, PDF watermarking, and RSS feed to JSON conversion. This comprehensive suite aims to offer an all-in-one solution for developers, streamlining the execution of common tasks and integrating essential functionalities into their projects.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'Developer Toolkit'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
